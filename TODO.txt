- deploy with Gradle inside Tomcat or Glassfish
- install Hamcrest matchers and rewrite assertions with them
- experiment with Hibernate for persistence
- install Findbugs (maybe with Gradle) for concurrency static analysis

Evolutions:
- multiple instances of the plane, making persistence into any database necessary (MongoDB driver)
- performance optimization driven by profiling
